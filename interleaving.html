        <h2> What is it?</h2>
        <div class="what">
            <p>
                When using Interleaving you switch between ideas during a study session. For example, if you were studying basic math, instead of practicing a lot of addition
            </p>

        </div>
        <h2>Why is it Effective?</h2>
        <div class="why">
        <p>Connections: studying ideas next to each other helps you to see what connects them. These connections can both help to clarify material and make stonger pathways for memory.</p>
        <p>Context: If you study the same things in the same order, you get used to that context for remembering them. If the test changes the order then context changes and it will be harder to remember. When you interleave you’re more ready to remember information in different contexts.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>How to use</h2>
        <div class="how">
            <p>Switch between topics (ie addition, subtraction, division, fractions)</p>
            <p>Switch the order you study the topics. Don’t always switch between the same topics in the same order. Vary it up.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>When to use</h2>
        <div class="when">
            <p>Interleaving works best when moving between topics that are related to each other. So it’s good to switch between topics in a class, but not as effective if you quickly switch from class to class.</p>
            <p>This is easiest for information or concepts that you can write down on cards. </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
        <div class="tipstricks">
            <p>Don’t go too fast. Although this is about switching it up, make sure you understand an idea before moving on to the next one.</p>
            <p>Put your study materials on flash cards and then make one pile and jumble them up each time yoru study. There are apps that will help do this for you.</p>
