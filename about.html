            <h3>Who is this Site For?</h3>
            <div class="about">
            <p>This site is for students. While students at any level may benefit from the site, it was created
                specifically for college students</p>

            <h3>Why is this Site Made?</h3>
            <p>A lot of college students have difficulty learning and remembering the material they are presented because they have never been taught any strategies to help them prepare for
                quizzes and exams and other assessments. The goal of this site is to give students some specific skills that they can begin to use to help them study smarter and more effectively.</p>

            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>This site owes a large debt to the wonderful materials in <a rel="" href=" https://www.learningscientists.org">The Learning Scientist Site.</a> Through the site itself, their blog, podcasts, videos and downloadable materials they provide a wealth of information on this topic.
                While that site serves teachers, students and parents, thissite reframes a number of the core ideas from that site specifically with students in mind. There is a wealth of information on the web and each skill has a Resources area with links to more information.
                Thank you to all of the researchers studying how people learn and the teachers and students working to put the research into practice in effective ways.</p>
